My research explores how young people interact with AI, how we can design curricula to support responsible AI use and creation, and how educational policy can guide the integration of AI into schools. 

A central part of my work is curriculum design. I have created hands-on learning experiences that introduce Kâ€“12 students to the responsible use of AI. These programs have reached thousands of learners worldwide through initiatives like [Day of AI](https://dayofai.org), [Project STEM](https://projectstem.org/middle-school-cs2-demo/cse2-scope-and-sequence), [Edward M. Kennedy Institute](https://emkinstitute.org/offerings-6-8/), and [Everyday AI](https://everyday-ai.org/). Most recently, I have designed an after school program, [Student Voices in AI](https://mitmedialab.github.io/student-voices-in-ai), which empowers students to take a leadership role in deciding how AI is used in their schools.

I am currently a PhD Candidate at the MIT Media Lab advised by Professor Cynthia Breazeal. I have a Bachelor's in Human Factors Engineering from Tufts University and a Master's in Media Arts and Sciences from MIT. Prior to my graduate work, I worked as a design researcher at Jibo, Inc., which was recognized as Time Magazine's Invention of the Year in 2017.

I will be graduating in May 2026 and am seeking faculty or other academic roles. Please reach out if you'd like to connect!
