This curriculum, designed for my Master's thesis and now adapted by <a href="https://education.mit.edu/project/raica-responsible-ai-for-computational-action/">MIT RAICA<a> is made up of 6 lessons that cover various topics in social robotics such as character design, affective computing, and computer vision.

The original curriculum is available <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1shtnWVERELr52tqcNhvhzmxVql6fQDKc2wFvt_PJh5Q/edit?usp=sharing">open source<a> for educators to implement in their classroom.
