The Daily-AI workshop, designed by the MIT Media Lab, MIT STEP Lab, and Boston College, is a 30-hour curriculum and features hands-on and computer-based activities on AI concepts, ethical issues in AI, creative expression using AI, and how AI relates to career futures. I had a primary role in creating the lessons and piloted the workshop in the Summer of 2020 with over 100 students. The curriculum has been adapted for the <a href="https://everyday-ai.org/">EverydayAI Project</a>.
