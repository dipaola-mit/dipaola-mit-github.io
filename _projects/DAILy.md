The Daily-AI workshop, designed by the MIT Media Lab, MIT STEP Lab, and Boston College, is a 30-hour curriculum and features hands-on and computer-based activities on AI concepts, ethical issues in AI, creative expression using AI, and how AI relates to career futures. I had a primary role in creating the lessons and piloted the workshop in the Summer of 2020 with over 100 students.

The curriculum has since been adapted for the <a href="https://everyday-ai.org/">EverydayAI Project</a>. In 2022, we led a Make-a-thon for educators participating in the EverydayAI project. The Make-a-thon introduced participants to new concepts in AI and allowed them to work in groups to design new lesson plans for curriculum they would like to see. Work from the Make-a-thon was <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3545945.3569743"> published in the 2023 SIGCSE Conference<a>.
