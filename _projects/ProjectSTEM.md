CSE2 is a middle-school course about AI, sponsored by <a href="https://projectstem.org/">Project STEM<a> and <a href="https://www.amazonfutureengineer.com/">Amazon Future Engineer<a>. I had a main role in designing the learning activities for the 12-week course, which covers all topics from the AI4K12 framework: including ethical thinking, representation, reasoning, machine learning, generative AI, and applied AI.
