The Student Voices in AI program empowers students to lead conversations about how AI should be used in their schools. Over 12 weeks, students build confidence in navigating AI in their school lives, engage their community to understand local perspectives, and propose school guidelines or policies. Through a mix of projects, activities, and conversations, the club fosters community dialogue and helps teens develop a thoughtful approach to using AI in school.

The club is currently being piloted with school districts in the US.
