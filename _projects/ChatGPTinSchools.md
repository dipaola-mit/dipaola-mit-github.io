This curriculum is an introduction to ChatGPT that I designed in collaboration with <a href="https://safinahali.com/">Safinah Ali</a>, <a href="https://i2learning.org/">i2 learning</a> and <a href="https://www.dayofai.org/">Day of AI</a>. Through a series of teacher-led activities they are introduced to ChatGPT, what it is and how it works, and come up with recommendations for how ChatGPT should be used and not used in their school.
